### Details
The main program [BlackJack.vi](/BlackJack.vi) uses tons of condition structures to determine 
whether Black-Jack, Insurance or Double-Down occurs, so it may seems very 
complicated :(

**The functions of all the sub VIs:**    
- [Draw.vi](/subVIs/Draw.vi) draws a card from the deck, and return one id of the card. 
- [DealerDraw.vi](/subVIs/DealerDraw.vi) is the program for dealer to draw a card.
- [Judge.vi](/subVIs/Judge.vi) compares the value of player's cards and dealer's cards.  
- [Result.vi](/subVIs/Result.vi) shows the result, and calculates the change of chips.  
- [ShowCards.vi](/subVIs/ShowCards.vi) converts the id of card into the image, and shows the image.  
- [ShowCards(Cover).vi](/subVIs/ShowCards(Cover).vi) covers the first card of dealer.  
- [Sum.vi](/subVIs/Sum.vi) sums the value of cards.
