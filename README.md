### Introduction to the Program
The main program `BlackJack.vi` uses tons of condition structures to determine 
whether Black-Jack, Insurance or Double-Down occurs, so it may seems very 
complicated :(

The functions of all the sub VIs:
`DealerDraw.vi` is the program for dealer to draw a card.
`Draw.vi` draws a card from the deck, and return one id of the card.
`Judge.vi` compares the value of player's cards and dealer's cards.
`Result.vi` shows the result, and calculates the change of chips.
`ShowCards.vi` converts the id of card into the image, and shows the image.
`ShowCards(Cover).vi` covers the first card of dealer.
`Sum.vi` sums the value of cards.
